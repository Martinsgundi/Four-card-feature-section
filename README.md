### What I learned

This project strengthened my knowledge on layouts. It also gave me the opportunity to practise my CSS grid skills which I just started learning, but I later used flexbox to carry out the project.


### Continued development

I will love to strenghten my knowledge on CSS grid and use it to design nice responsive layouts, and also want to work on more advanced projects in other to deepen my knowledge in general.
